	<h1>1. Features</h1>

	<p>Notes &amp; Folders is yet another notes application. It's not
		the best one, but only here you can organize your notes by folders
		just like in real file system.</p>

	<p>Current key features are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Plain text notes, checklists and folders</li>
		<li>Password protection and 128-bit AES encryption</li>
		<li>Importing UTF-8 *.txt files</li>
		<li>Searching</li>
		<li>Backup &amp; Restore</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I'm planning to implement these:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Exporting data</li>
		<li>Color schemes</li>
		<li>Multiple selection for copy/cut/paste</li>
	</ul>

	<p>And these features I don't want and won't implement because
		there're already many powerful applications having them:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Images, sounds, videos</li>
		<li>Tags, links</li>
		<li>Text formatting</li>
		<li>Widgets for taking quick notes</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I wanted Notes &amp; Folders to be an Android clone of my old <a
			href="http://mynotes.zx6.ru/">MyNotes</a> (which is a similar
		application for Java ME).
	</p>

	<h1>2. Details</h1>

	<h2>2.1. Encryption</h2>

	<p>
		Encryption algorithm is <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
		with 128-bit key.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your data is encrypted with key that is randomly generated at the
		first start of application and that never changes. The key itself is
		encrypted with password that you use to log in. The password in its
		turn is hashed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a>
		algorithm.
	</p>

	<p>Only text content of notes is encrypted. Names, dates and other
		system information stay not encrypted.</p>

	<h2>2.2. Data import</h2>

	<p>
		It is about importing *.txt files. Their text content is expected to
		be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> encoding.
		If it's not there would probably be problems with reading notes.
	</p>

	<p>You can choose either a single *.txt file or a folder to import.</p>

	<p>The imported data goes into the folder "Imported at YYYY.MM.DD
		HH:MM:SS" that is created in the root folder. You have to manually
		copy/move data from it to the place you want.</p>

	<h2>2.3. Checklists</h2>
	<p>You can reorder items by drag'n'dropping them (to start dragging an item click it on the right side)</p>
	
	<h2>2.4. Backup &amp; Restore</h2>
	<p>Backup process saves data in a single file on sdcard. The data being saved is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>SHA-1 hash of password</li>
		<li>Key used to encrypted data (encrypted with password)</li>
		<li>Data (folders, notes and checklists). Only text content is encrypted. Names and dates stay not encrypted.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>File is created in /mnt/sdcard/NotesAndFolders folder (it is created automatically if it doesn't exist). File has an 
	*.nf1 extension.</p>
	<p>You can use that files to restore data from them. The process of restoring data involves following steps: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Deleting all data in database</li>
		<li>Restoring password and encryption key</li>
		<li>Restoring data</li>
		<li>Restarting the application</li>
	</ul>
